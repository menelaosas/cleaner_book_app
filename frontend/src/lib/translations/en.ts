    // Kitchen
    kitchenTip1Title: 'Clean as you cook',
    kitchenTip1Desc: 'Wash dishes and wipe surfaces while waiting for food to cook. This prevents buildup and makes post-meal cleanup take just a few minutes.',
    kitchenTip2Title: 'Degrease with baking soda paste',
    kitchenTip2Desc: 'Mix baking soda with a little water to form a paste. Apply to greasy stovetops and oven doors, let it sit for 15 minutes, then wipe clean. Works better than most chemical sprays.',
    kitchenTip3Title: 'Microwave cleaning hack',
    kitchenTip3Desc: 'Place a bowl of water with lemon slices inside and microwave for 3 minutes. The steam loosens grime, and you can wipe everything clean with a single cloth.',
    kitchenTip4Title: 'Descale your kettle naturally',
    kitchenTip4Desc: 'Fill the kettle with equal parts water and white vinegar. Boil, let it sit for an hour, then rinse. Do this monthly to prevent mineral buildup.',
    kitchenTip5Title: 'Organize your fridge weekly',
    kitchenTip5Desc: 'Every week before grocery shopping, remove expired items, wipe shelves with a damp cloth, and reorganize. This prevents odors and food waste.',
    kitchenTip6Title: 'Deep clean the sink drain',
    kitchenTip6Desc: 'Pour half a cup of baking soda followed by half a cup of vinegar down the drain. Wait 15 minutes, then flush with boiling water. Do this bi-weekly to prevent clogs and odors.',
    kitchenTip7Title: 'Clean behind appliances quarterly',
    kitchenTip7Desc: 'Pull out the fridge, oven, and dishwasher to vacuum and mop behind them. Dust buildup behind the fridge can increase energy consumption by up to 25%.',
    kitchenTip8Title: 'Season your cutting boards',
    kitchenTip8Desc: 'Rub wooden cutting boards with coarse salt and half a lemon to disinfect. Then apply a thin layer of mineral oil to prevent cracking and absorbing odors.',
    // Living Room
    livingTip1Title: 'Dust top to bottom',
    livingTip1Desc: 'Always start from ceiling fans and high shelves, working your way down to furniture and floors. Dust falls, so this order means you never clean the same surface twice.',
    livingTip2Title: 'Refresh upholstery with baking soda',
    livingTip2Desc: 'Sprinkle baking soda generously over your sofa and cushions. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes to absorb odors, then vacuum thoroughly.',
    livingTip3Title: 'Use lint rollers on lampshades',
    livingTip3Desc: 'Fabric lampshades attract dust that is hard to vacuum. A lint roller picks it up quickly without damaging the material.',
    livingTip4Title: 'Clean remote controls weekly',
    livingTip4Desc: 'Wipe remotes, game controllers, and phones with a disinfectant wipe. These are some of the most germ-covered items in your home.',
    livingTip5Title: 'Rotate and flip cushions monthly',
    livingTip5Desc: 'Rotating cushions and flipping reversible ones distributes wear evenly and keeps your furniture looking newer for longer.',
    livingTip6Title: 'Vacuum under furniture monthly',
    livingTip6Desc: 'Move sofas and chairs to vacuum underneath. Dust bunnies under furniture get recirculated every time you walk by, reducing air quality.',
    livingTip7Title: 'Clean windows for brighter rooms',
    livingTip7Desc: 'Mix equal parts water and white vinegar in a spray bottle. Use newspaper instead of paper towels for streak-free glass — the ink acts as a mild abrasive.',
    // Bathroom
    bathroomTip1Title: 'Squeegee after every shower',
    bathroomTip1Desc: 'Spend 30 seconds squeegeeing glass doors and tile walls after showering. This prevents 90% of soap scum and hard water buildup, saving you hours of deep cleaning.',
    bathroomTip2Title: 'Clean grout with hydrogen peroxide',
    bathroomTip2Desc: 'Spray hydrogen peroxide directly on grout lines, let it sit for 10 minutes, then scrub with an old toothbrush. For tough stains, make a paste with baking soda.',
    bathroomTip3Title: 'Prevent mirror fog with dish soap',
    bathroomTip3Desc: 'Apply a small amount of dish soap to a cloth and wipe the mirror. Buff until clear. This creates an invisible barrier that prevents fogging for about a week.',
    bathroomTip4Title: 'Deep clean the toilet with vinegar',
    bathroomTip4Desc: 'Pour a cup of white vinegar into the bowl before bed. Let it sit overnight, then scrub and flush in the morning. The acid dissolves mineral deposits and kills bacteria.',
    bathroomTip5Title: 'Wash shower curtains monthly',
    bathroomTip5Desc: 'Throw fabric or plastic shower curtains in the washing machine with a couple of towels (they act as scrubbers). Add baking soda to the wash cycle and vinegar to the rinse.',
    bathroomTip6Title: 'Unclog drains with a zip tie',
    bathroomTip6Desc: 'Cut small barbs along the sides of a zip tie to create a DIY drain snake. Insert it into the drain and pull out hair and debris. Much cheaper than chemical drain cleaners.',
    bathroomTip7Title: 'Ventilate to prevent mold',
    bathroomTip7Desc: 'Always run the exhaust fan for at least 20 minutes after showering. If you do not have a fan, leave the door open. Mold needs moisture, and ventilation is your best defense.',
    // Bedroom
    bedroomTip1Title: 'Make the bed every morning',
    bedroomTip1Desc: 'Making your bed takes 2 minutes and instantly makes the room look 80% tidier. It also sets a productive tone for the rest of the day.',
    bedroomTip2Title: 'Wash pillows every 3 months',
    bedroomTip2Desc: 'Pillows accumulate dead skin, dust mites, and sweat. Most can go in the washing machine — use warm water and an extra rinse cycle. Dry with tennis balls to prevent clumping.',
    bedroomTip3Title: 'Flip your mattress seasonally',
    bedroomTip3Desc: 'Rotate your mattress 180 degrees every 3 months. If it is double-sided, flip it too. This distributes wear and extends the mattress lifespan by years.',
    bedroomTip4Title: 'Declutter nightstands weekly',
    bedroomTip4Desc: 'Keep only essentials on your nightstand: a lamp, a book, and maybe a glass of water. Clear everything else. Clutter near your bed disrupts sleep quality.',
    bedroomTip5Title: 'Dust ceiling fans and light fixtures',
    bedroomTip5Desc: 'Use a pillowcase to clean ceiling fan blades — slide it over each blade and pull back. The dust stays inside the pillowcase instead of falling onto your bed.',
    bedroomTip6Title: 'Air out your bedroom daily',
    bedroomTip6Desc: 'Open windows for at least 10 minutes each morning. Fresh air reduces humidity, eliminates odors, and creates a healthier sleeping environment.',
    // Closet
    closetTip1Title: 'The reverse hanger trick',
    closetTip1Desc: 'Hang all clothes with hangers facing backward. After wearing something, hang it the normal way. After 6 months, donate everything still reversed — you clearly do not need it.',
    closetTip2Title: 'Use the one-in-one-out rule',
    closetTip2Desc: 'Every time you buy something new, donate or discard one existing item. This prevents closet overflow and forces mindful purchasing.',
    closetTip3Title: 'Store seasonal items separately',
    closetTip3Desc: 'Keep off-season clothes in vacuum-sealed bags or storage bins. This frees up daily-use space and protects clothing from dust and moths.',
    closetTip4Title: 'Fold sweaters instead of hanging',
    closetTip4Desc: 'Hanging heavy knits stretches them out at the shoulders. Fold them and stack on shelves or use shelf dividers to keep piles neat.',
    closetTip5Title: 'Add cedar blocks for freshness',
    closetTip5Desc: 'Cedar naturally repels moths and absorbs moisture. Place cedar blocks or rings on hangers. Sand them lightly every few months to refresh the scent.',
    closetTip6Title: 'Organize by category then color',
    closetTip6Desc: 'Group items by type (shirts, pants, dresses) then arrange each group by color from light to dark. This makes finding outfits faster and visually calming.',
    closetTip7Title: 'Clean closet floors monthly',
    closetTip7Desc: 'Remove shoes and items from the closet floor. Vacuum thoroughly — closets collect surprising amounts of dust, lint, and hair.',
    // Dining
    diningTip1Title: 'Wipe the table after every meal',
    diningTip1Desc: 'Use a damp microfiber cloth after each meal. Food residue left even for a few hours attracts bacteria and becomes harder to remove once dried.',
    diningTip2Title: 'Polish wooden tables with olive oil',
    diningTip2Desc: 'Mix 2 parts olive oil with 1 part lemon juice. Apply with a soft cloth in the direction of the wood grain. Buff dry for a natural, chemical-free shine.',
    diningTip3Title: 'Clean chair legs and undersides',
    diningTip3Desc: 'Flip chairs and clean the legs, crossbars, and undersides quarterly. These areas collect dust, food crumbs, and scuff marks that are easy to overlook.',
    diningTip4Title: 'Protect surfaces with placemats',
    diningTip4Desc: 'Use placemats and coasters consistently. Prevention is always easier than removing heat marks, water rings, or scratches from a dining table.',
    diningTip5Title: 'Vacuum under the dining table daily',
    diningTip5Desc: 'Crumbs under the table attract pests. A quick daily vacuum takes 30 seconds and prevents bigger problems.',
    // Garage
    garageTip1Title: 'Use vertical storage',
    garageTip1Desc: 'Install wall-mounted pegboards, hooks, and shelving. Getting items off the floor makes cleaning easier and doubles your usable space.',
    garageTip2Title: 'Label everything clearly',
    garageTip2Desc: 'Use a label maker or masking tape to label every box and bin. Include a brief contents list. Future you will be grateful when searching for holiday decorations.',
    garageTip3Title: 'Sweep the garage floor monthly',
    garageTip3Desc: 'Garages accumulate dirt, leaves, and debris quickly. A monthly sweep prevents buildup that becomes much harder to clean later.',
    garageTip4Title: 'Sort into zones',
    garageTip4Desc: 'Create dedicated zones: tools, sports equipment, seasonal items, automotive supplies. This prevents the "dump everything" habit that leads to chaos.',
    garageTip5Title: 'Declutter annually',
    garageTip5Desc: 'Once a year, go through everything in storage. Broken tools, expired products, and items you have not used in 2 years should go. Be ruthless.',
    garageTip6Title: 'Clean oil stains with cat litter',
    garageTip6Desc: 'Cover fresh oil stains with clay-based cat litter. Grind it in with your foot, leave overnight, then sweep. The litter absorbs the oil from the concrete.',
    // Kids
    kidsTip1Title: 'Make cleanup a game',
    kidsTip1Desc: 'Set a timer and challenge kids to pick up as many toys as possible. Use color-coded bins so even toddlers know where things go. Consistency builds habits.',
    kidsTip2Title: 'Rotate toys',
    kidsTip2Desc: 'Keep half the toys in storage and swap them every few weeks. Kids get excited about "new" toys, and fewer items out means less mess and easier cleanup.',
    kidsTip3Title: 'Sanitize toys weekly',
    kidsTip3Desc: 'Plastic toys can go in the dishwasher (top rack, no heat dry). Stuffed animals can go in a pillowcase in the washing machine. This is especially important during cold and flu season.',
    kidsTip4Title: 'Use washable wall paint',
    kidsTip4Desc: 'Semi-gloss or satin finish paint wipes clean with a damp cloth. Crayon marks, fingerprints, and mystery smudges come off easily without repainting.',
    kidsTip5Title: 'Install low hooks and shelves',
    kidsTip5Desc: 'Put hooks and storage at kid height so they can hang their own bags and put away their own things. Independence reduces your workload.',
    kidsTip6Title: 'Establish a nightly 10-minute tidy',
    kidsTip6Desc: 'Before bedtime, everyone spends 10 minutes putting things back. Make it a routine, not a punishment. Play music to make it enjoyable.',
    // Pets
    petsTip1Title: 'Lint roller on everything',
    petsTip1Desc: 'Keep lint rollers in every room. A quick pass over cushions, throws, and clothing before guests arrive makes a huge difference.',
    petsTip2Title: 'Use a rubber glove for pet hair',
    petsTip2Desc: 'Put on a damp rubber glove and run your hand over upholstered furniture. Pet hair clings to the rubber like a magnet. Rinse the glove and repeat.',
    petsTip3Title: 'Wash pet bedding weekly',
    petsTip3Desc: 'Pet beds harbor dander, bacteria, and odors. Use hot water and an extra rinse cycle. Sprinkle baking soda on the bed between washes to absorb smells.',
    petsTip4Title: 'Clean food and water bowls daily',
    petsTip4Desc: 'Wash pet bowls with soap and hot water every day. Biofilm (the slimy coating) builds up within hours and can make pets sick.',
    petsTip5Title: 'Vacuum high-traffic pet areas daily',
    petsTip5Desc: 'Areas where pets sleep, eat, and play need daily vacuuming. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to capture allergens effectively.',
    petsTip6Title: 'Neutralize odors with enzymatic cleaners',
    petsTip6Desc: 'For accidents, use an enzymatic cleaner, not regular soap. Enzymes break down the organic compounds that cause odors. Regular cleaners just mask the smell.',
    // Eco
    ecoTip1Title: 'The vinegar all-purpose cleaner',
    ecoTip1Desc: 'Mix equal parts water and white vinegar in a spray bottle. Add a few drops of essential oil for scent. This replaces most store-bought surface cleaners for pennies.',
    ecoTip2Title: 'Switch to microfiber cloths',
    ecoTip2Desc: 'Microfiber cloths clean better than paper towels and are reusable hundreds of times. They trap dust and bacteria without chemicals — just use water.',
    ecoTip3Title: 'Make your own scrub',
    ecoTip3Desc: 'Mix baking soda, liquid castile soap, and a few drops of tea tree oil. This paste scrubs sinks, tubs, and tiles without harsh chemicals.',
    ecoTip4Title: 'Use newspaper for glass cleaning',
    ecoTip4Desc: 'Old newspapers with water and vinegar clean glass streak-free. The ink acts as a mild polishing agent. Better results than paper towels and completely free.',
    ecoTip5Title: 'Lemon as a natural deodorizer',
    ecoTip5Desc: 'Run lemon peels through the garbage disposal to eliminate odors. Place lemon halves in the fridge to absorb smells. Rub a cut lemon on cutting boards to disinfect.',
    ecoTip6Title: 'Steam clean with just water',
    ecoTip6Desc: 'A steam cleaner sanitizes floors, countertops, and bathroom fixtures using only water. The high temperature kills 99.9% of bacteria without any chemical residue.',
